  Warnings:

  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[transactionId]` on the table `Payment` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - The required column `transactionId` was added to the `Payment` table with a prisma-level default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty. Please add this column as optional, then populate it before making it required.
